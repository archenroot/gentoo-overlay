    A repository manager stores and organizes binary software components 
    for use in development, deployment, and provisioning. Repository managers
    serve five primary purposess:
    - Provides a central point for management and governance for all binary
    software components and their dependencies
    - Acts as highly configurable proxy between your organization and public
    repositories
    - Establishes a deployment destination for internally developed binary
    components
    - Enables staging of releases to a temporary repository which can then be
    used to test and certify a set of artifacts, before they are released
    - Supports improved security and privacy surrounding what components are 
    being used across the development organization
    
    Repository managers have become essential infrastructure for 
    component-based software development. To the right is a diagram that 
    depicts where a repository manager fits into a typical development
    process.
