    GlassFish is a Java application server project created by Sun Microsystems
    that allows many developers to generate enterprise technologies that are
    convenient and scalable, as well as additional services that can be
    installed based on preference. It is a free, dual-licensed software under
    the GNU General Public License (GPL) and the Common Development and
    Distribution License (CDDL). GlassFish was acquired by Oracle in 2010.
